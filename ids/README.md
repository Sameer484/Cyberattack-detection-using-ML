# Use of Machine Learning for detection of abnormal flow of traffic and known network attacks.

### Repository of the code for my final year project.

I employed the CICIDS2017 dataset to create a real-time network intrusion detection system. Through meticulous data preprocessing, feature selection, and rigorous algorithm evaluation with hyperparameter optimization, I achieved a remarkable 99.91% accuracy and a 97.59% F1 Score using a Random Forest classifier. This outcome demonstrates the model's potential for effectively distinguishing between benign and malicious network traffic, making it a promising foundation for intrusion detection systems.
